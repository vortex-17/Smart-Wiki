# Smart Wiki

This is a fast and safe concurrent web crawler which scans wikipedia pages and sends back the most links relevant to the searched term. This is based on Go-colly. Links can be accessed via API calls.

Currently the application works in the localhost, port 3000.

Plan to expand this to a working productin crawler.
